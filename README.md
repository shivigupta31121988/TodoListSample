# TodoListSample
just an html file, to showcase dynamically adding textboxes and deleting them, to add and remove items from a to do list.

Creates text boxes dynamically by appending to the parent paragraph element.

The textboxes created are made to appear like labels when the focus is removed.

The textboxes will also have a delete button next to it which is only visible when the user hovers over the text.
